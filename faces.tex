\section{What is a Face?}

A \textit{Face} is a specific type of Non-Protagonist Character (or "Non-Player Character" or "NPC", run by a game's facilitator). A Face is a person in the story who serves as a narrative proxy for something intangible or impersonal, like a religion, a social movement, or a government. Through interacting with the Face, we learn about what they represent, called the \textit{Locus}. At the same time, a Face is still an individual, and has their own hopes, dreams, and motivations. For example, in "Star Wars", Darth Vader can be seen as one Face of the Empire. Vader is powerful and does bad things, and so does the Empire. But the Empire doesn't have a son, while Vader does, and that fact changes the Empire through Vader killing the Emperor.

\section{Using Faces}

When you want the players to interact with a Locus, like a kingdom, a conspiracy, or an enemy army, they should do so through a Face character. The Face's actions should reflect their personality and motives, as well as the Locus and its interests. If the Locus's situation is complicated, the players might encounter multiple Faces. Faces serving the same Locus can be in conflict with each other, or cooperate but have their own takes on a situation.

Faces are strongest when multiple Faces and multiple Loci are in play. For example, the PCs can interact with both a heroic Rebel leader and a stuffy Imperial commander, but those two Faces will have a relationship and history as well.

Here are some principles for portraying a Face:

\textbf{Put a human face on the Locus}

\textbf{Enact the Locus's agenda, but in your own way}

\textbf{Push situations forward by revealing your conflicts}

\textbf{Ignore the Locus' interests in favor of a personal conflict}

\textbf{Offer a means for players to change the Locus' agenda or nature}

\section{Creating Faces}

To quickly create a Face, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick an emotion from the Emotion Table
\item Name the source or object of this emotion in the Face's life, e.g. "they feel Grief at the loss of lives under their command" or "they feel Loathing toward the Rebel scum"
\item Start with at least one \textit{conflict}, either internal or external (see below)
\item If desired, add more conflicts
\end{enumerate}

Our interest in the Face as players is how we interact with the Face and their conflicts. Ideally, the Faceâ€™s conflicts will also tie back to the player characters' own goals and histories. There is no "right" number of conflicts, but 1 is good for a low-ranking individual, and 2-3 indicates someone with more story importance.

\subsection{Creating Internal Conflicts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick a new emotion from the Emotion Table
\item Name the source or object of this emotion, just as before, e.g. "they feel Admiration toward an Imperial officer"
\item Relate this new emotion back to their primary emotion, e.g. "the Imperial officer was responsible for harming many Rebels"
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Creating External Conflicts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Name another character (a Face, PC, or other character) or another Locus
\item Name a shared sphere of influence or interest, e.g. "the military occupation of our lands"
\item Name a point of contention between the Face and that other party within that sphere, e.g. "the other Rebel commander is much more aggressive than I prefer"
\end{enumerate}

\columnbreak

\section{Emotion Table}

Roll a d8 for emotion. Reroll if you get a result you've already gotten. Then either pick or roll a d6 for intensity. If you use everything, start reusing stuff.

Emotions can shade into each other. Look at the optional interpretations and pick one if it makes sense.

\begin{enumerate}
\item [1:] Ecstacy (1-2), Joy (3-4), Serenity (5-6). Optional: Optimism, Love
\item [2:] Admiration (1-2), Trust (3-4), or Acceptance (5-6). Optional: Love, Submission
\item [3:] Terror (1-2), Fear (3-4), or Apprehension (5-6). Optional: Submission, Awe
\item [4:] Amazement (1-2), Surprise (3-4), or Distraction (5-6). Optional: Awe, Disapproval
\item [5:] Grief (1-2), Sadness (3-4), or Pensiveness (5-6). Optional: Disapproval, Remorse
\item [6:] Loathing (1-2), Disgust (3-4), or Boredom (5-6). Optional: Remorse, Contempt
\item [7:] Rage (1-2), Anger (3-4), or Annoyance (5-6). Optional: Contempt, Aggressiveness
\item [8:] Vigilance (1-2), Anticipation (3-4), or Interest (5-6). Optional: Aggressiveness, Optimism
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example Faces}

The \textbf{Noble} is a representative of social power in their city. They feel Serenity toward the system of nobility and their own position - they are blithely self-satisfied. They have an external conflict with the lower class, centered on wealth disparity, and they believe wealth is an earned privilege.

The \textbf{Schemer} is someone who actively works to maintain the aristocratic system by any means. They feel Rage toward threats to that system. They have an internal conflict rooted in Grief, because they secretly emerged from the poverty of the slums and fought their way into their current position.

The \textbf{Demagogue} represents the underclass. They feel Loathing toward the aristocrats' opulent and wasteful lifestyles.
They have two conflicts: an internal Vigilance against not letting their dislike become a personal hatred of people,
and an external conflict with their ex-spouse the Schemer, over the place of the poor in the city.
